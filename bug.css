The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results when used with percentages and other units. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected in all browsers or situations.  Another issue is specificity conflicts. When multiple CSS rules target the same element, specificity determines which rule wins.  A common mistake is accidentally giving higher specificity to a less important rule, overriding a more important one.
